Typically this is intended for actions that take\n   * a few seconds, and therefore would be bad to wait for within a request, or actions that need to happen\n   * when a core has zero references, but but would not pose a significant hindrance to server shut down times.\n   * It is not intended for long running tasks and if you are using a Runnable with a loop in it, you are\n   * almost certainly doing it wrong.\n   * <p><br>\n   * WARNING: Solr wil not be able to shut down gracefully until this task completes!\n   * <p><br>\n   * A significant upside of using this method vs creating your own ExecutorService is that your code\n   * does not have to properly shutdown executors which typically is risky from a unit testing\n   * perspective since the test framework will complain if you don't carefully ensure the executor\n   * shuts down before the end of the test. Also the threads running this task are sure to have\n   * a proper MDC for logging.\n   * <p><br>\n   * Normally, one uses {@link SolrCore#runAsync(Runnable)} if possible, but in some cases\n   * you might need to execute a task asynchronously when you could be running on a node with no\n   * cores, and then use of this method is indicated.\n   *\n   * @param r the task to run\n   */\n  public void runAsync(Runnable r) {\n    coreContainerAsyncTaskExecutor.submit(r);\n  }\n\n","sourceOld":null,"bugFix":null,"bugIntro":[],"isBuggy":false,"nexts":[],"revCommit":null}],"commit2Parents":{"a0e7ee9d0d12370e8d2b5ae0a23b6e687e018d85":[],"b627755385655c7cd3fb296f17593658805cf4d5":["a0e7ee9d0d12370e8d2b5ae0a23b6e687e018d85"],"cd5edd1f2b162a5cfa08efd17851a07373a96817":["b627755385655c7cd3fb296f17593658805cf4d5"]},"commit2Childs":{"a0e7ee9d0d12370e8d2b5ae0a23b6e687e018d85":["b627755385655c7cd3fb296f17593658805cf4d5"],"b627755385655c7cd3fb296f17593658805cf4d5":["cd5edd1f2b162a5cfa08efd17851a07373a96817"],"cd5edd1f2b162a5cfa08efd17851a07373a96817":[]},"heads":["cd5edd1f2b162a5cfa08efd17851a07373a96817"],"roots":["a0e7ee9d0d12370e8d2b5ae0a23b6e687e018d85"],"pathCommit":null}
