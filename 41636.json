A soft delete field in lucene is a doc-values field that marks a document as soft-deleted if a\n   * document has at least one value in that field. If a document is marked as soft-deleted the document is treated as\n   * if it has been hard-deleted through the IndexWriter API ({@link IndexWriter#deleteDocuments(Term...)}.\n   * Merges will reclaim soft-deleted as well as hard-deleted documents and index readers obtained from the IndexWriter\n   * will reflect all deleted documents in it's live docs. If soft-deletes are used documents must be indexed via\n   * {@link IndexWriter#softUpdateDocument(Term, Iterable, Field...)}. Deletes are applied via\n   * {@link IndexWriter#updateDocValues(Term, Field...)}.\n   *\n   * Soft deletes allow to retain documents across merges if the merge policy modifies the live docs of a merge reader.\n   * {@link SoftDeletesRetentionMergePolicy} for instance allows to specify an arbitrary query to mark all documents\n   * that should survive the merge. This can be used to for example keep all document modifications for a certain time\n   * interval or the last N operations if some kind of sequence ID is available in the index.\n   *\n   * Currently there is no API support to un-delete a soft-deleted document. In oder to un-delete the document must be\n   * re-indexed using {@link IndexWriter#softUpdateDocument(Term, Iterable, Field...)}.\n   *\n   * The default value for this is <code>null</code> which disables soft-deletes. If soft-deletes are enabled documents\n   * can still be hard-deleted. Hard-deleted documents will won't considered as soft-deleted even if they have\n   * a value in the soft-deletes field.\n   *\n   * @see #getSoftDeletesField()\n   */\n  public IndexWriterConfig setSoftDeletesField(String softDeletesField) {\n    this.softDeletesField = softDeletesField;\n    return this;\n  }\n\n","sourceOld":null,"bugFix":null,"bugIntro":[],"isBuggy":false,"nexts":[],"revCommit":null}],"commit2Parents":{"5ee0394b8176abd7c90a4be8c05465be1879db79":["a0e7ee9d0d12370e8d2b5ae0a23b6e687e018d85"],"a0e7ee9d0d12370e8d2b5ae0a23b6e687e018d85":[],"cd5edd1f2b162a5cfa08efd17851a07373a96817":["5ee0394b8176abd7c90a4be8c05465be1879db79"]},"commit2Childs":{"5ee0394b8176abd7c90a4be8c05465be1879db79":["cd5edd1f2b162a5cfa08efd17851a07373a96817"],"a0e7ee9d0d12370e8d2b5ae0a23b6e687e018d85":["5ee0394b8176abd7c90a4be8c05465be1879db79"],"cd5edd1f2b162a5cfa08efd17851a07373a96817":[]},"heads":["cd5edd1f2b162a5cfa08efd17851a07373a96817"],"roots":["a0e7ee9d0d12370e8d2b5ae0a23b6e687e018d85"],"pathCommit":null}
